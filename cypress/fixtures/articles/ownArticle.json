You can run the locally instrumented server and client using `npm run dev:coverage` command. The backend coverage is exposed in [server/server/index.js](server/server/index.js) via endpoint listed in [cypress.json](cypress.json) (usually `GET /__coverage`). The frontend coverage is collected by instrumenting the web application source code on the fly, see the [client/.babelrc](client/.babelrc) file.\n\nThe combined report is saved in `coverage/index.html` after the tests finish:\n\n![Example full coverage report](images/full-coverage.png)\n\nThe coverage is sent to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cypress-io/cypress-example-realworld) using command `npm run coveralls` from CircleCI.\n\nTo learn more, read the [Cypress code coverage guide](https://on.cypress.io/coverage).\n\n[renovate-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-app-blue.svg\n[renovate-app]: https://renovateapp.com/",
